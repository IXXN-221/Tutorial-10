For each of the challenges you will need to edit the CSS of the appropriate page.

1. ## Askew
Alter the CSS so that when the div is hovered on the box rights itself to a non-skewed view.

2. ## Bounce
Have the 'Bouncy Title' enter the screen from the top of the screen and bounce once before settling.

3. ## Loading
Create a loading icon by animating the partial circles to rotate indefinitely. Try to have them moving moving out of sync with one another.

4. ## Rainbow
Have the text color cycle through the colours of the rainbow.
